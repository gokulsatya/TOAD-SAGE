## Threat Operations & Analysis Dashboard - Security Analysis Guidance Engine

TOAD SAGE is an innovative browser extension that serves as an AI-powered security analyst companion, combining real-time threat analysis with educational guidance. Think of it as having a knowledgeable security mentor right in your browser, helping you analyze security incidents while teaching you about relevant security concepts and frameworks.

### What Makes TOAD SAGE Special?
